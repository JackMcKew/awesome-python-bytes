*[https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/165/ranges-as-dictionary-keys-oh-my](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/165/ranges-as-dictionary-keys-oh-my)*

A light weight, zero dependency (only standard libs used), to the point (no bells and whistles) Microsoft Excel reader/writer python 2.7-3+ library.

[![Example Code](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl/blob/master/doc/source/_static/readme_demo.gif)](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl)

Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl

- (compatibility +1, small lib +1) pylightxl has no external dependencies (only uses python built-in standard libs).
(compatibility +1) pylightxl was written to be compatible for python 2.7-3+ under one single pylightxl version. It does not impose rules on users to switch versions.
- (small lib +1) pylightxl was written to simply read/write, thereby making the library small without any bells or whistles which makes it easy to compile with PyInstaller and other packagers
- (user friendly +1) pylightxl was written to be as pythonic and easy to use as possible. Core developers actively survey Stack Overflow questions on working with excel files to tailor the API for most common problems.
- (see xlrd before pylightxl) Note that the xlrd library is very similar in values to pylightxl, but with much more functionality! Please take a look at xlrd to see if it is a good fit for your project. So why pick pylightxl over xlrd that has much more to offer? Currently, xlrd does not have any active developers. Pylightxl is a new library aimed to help solve current excel data issues (as surveyed by Stack Overflow), please submit your suggestions to help improve this library together.

PySimpleGUI enables anyone with a week of PySimpleGUI education or more to develop an entirely custom desktop GUI application.  The underlying GUI frameworks supported include tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi.  PySimpleGUI code can be run on any of these underlying frameworks with little or often no modification to the source code.

Unlike other simplified GUI packages, PySimpleGUI has a rich palette of widgets that are not dumbed down and can be assembled into any configuration desired, resulting in applications that look and operate as if written directly in tkinter, Qt, etc.  Simple defines the ease of writing the programs, not the class of problems that are capable of being solved. 100's of demo programs are provided to give programmers a jump start on integrating with other packages such as OpenCV, Matplotlib.  There are over 500 GitHub projects currently using PySimpleGUI.

A couple recent projects include:

A series of Rainmeter-style "Desktop Widgets": <https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI-Widgets>

## [NBDev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/178/build-a-pypi-package-from-a-jupyter-notebook>*

`nbdev` is a library that allows you to fully develop a library in Jupyter Notebooks, putting all your code, tests and documentation in one place. That is: you now have a true literate programming environment, as envisioned by Donald Knuth back in 1983!

Using the interactive environment, you can easily debug and refactor your code. Add #export flags to the cells that define the functions you want to include in your python modules. Here, for instance, is how combined_cos is defined and documented in the `fastai` library:

[![NBDev Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev/master/nbs/images/export_example.png)](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

- Creates Python packages out of a notebook
- Creates documentation from the notebook
- Solves the git perma-conflict issues with git pre-commit hooks
- Use #export to declare a cell should become a function in the package
- Manages the boilerplate issues for creating Python packages (setup.py, etc)
- Makes testing possible inside notebooks
- Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and sync any changes automatically back into your notebooks (reverse basically)

## [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/30/you-are-not-google-and-other-ruminations>*

Hypothesis is a Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldn‚Äôt have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy to add to any existing test suite.

It works by letting you write tests that assert that something should be true for every case, not just the ones you happen to think of.

## [Safer](https://github.com/rec/safer)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/180/transactional-file-io-with-python-and-safer>*

safer: a safer file opener

No more partial writes or corruption! For file streams, sockets or any callable.

``` python
# dangerous
with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
    json.dump(data, fp)
    # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

# safer
with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
    json.dump(data, fp)
    # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.
```

## [Codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/180/transactional-file-io-with-python-and-safer>*

Fix common misspellings in text files. It's designed primarily for checking misspelled words in source code, but it can be used with other files as well.

## [Interrogate](https://pypi.org/project/interrogate/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/181/it-s-time-to-interrogate-your-python-code>*

`interrogate` checks your code base for missing docstrings.

Documentation should be as important as code itself. And it should live within code. Python standardized docstrings, allowing for developers to navigate libraries as simply as calling `help()` on objects, and with powerful tools like Sphinx, pydoc, and Docutils to automatically generate HTML, LaTeX, PDFs, etc.

Enter: `interrogate`.

`interrogate` will tell you which methods, functions, classes, and modules have docstrings, and which do not. Use interrogate to:

- Get an understanding of how well your code is documented;
- Add it to CI/CD checks to enforce documentation on newly-added code;
- Assess a new code base for (one aspect of) code quality and maintainability.

## [Alive-Progress](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/181/it-s-time-to-interrogate-your-python-code>*

A new kind of Progress Bar, with real-time throughput, eta and very cool animations!

``` python
from alive_progress import alive_bar
items = range(1000)                  # retrieve your set of items
with alive_bar(len(items)) as bar:   # declare your expected total
    for item in items:               # iterate as usual
        # process each item
        bar()                        # call after consuming one item
```

## [Unsync](https://github.com/alex-sherman/unsync)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/188/will-there-be-a-switch-in-python-the-language>*

Unsync makes functions asynchronous and parallelized with a single decorator `@unsync`.

A simple sleeping example with `asyncio`:

``` python
async def sync_async():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return 'I hate event loops'

result = asyncio.run(sync_async())
print(result)
```

Same example with `unsync`:

``` python
@unsync
async def unsync_async():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return 'I like decorators'

print(unsync_async().result())
```

## [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/190/you-will-now-be-notified-if-the-python-zipper-is-broken>*

Pylance has the ability to supercharge your Python IntelliSense experience with rich type information, helping you write better code faster.

- Features docstring automation, Signature help, parameter suggestions, code completion (better than existing)
- Supports auto-imports, if you start typing from a namespace, like a standard library module, it will add the import for you.
- Go to Reference, Go to Implementation shortcuts
- Uses the pyright type checker (an alternative to MyPy (Dropbox), Pyre (Facebook) and Pytype (Google))
- If you have pyright extension installed, remove it first!

## [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/191/live-from-the-manning-python-conference>*

Introduced in version 3.4, `pathlib` is a module in the standard library for dealing with paths for you! From the documentation itself *This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.*

An intro to `pathlib` blog post mentioned in episode 191 can be found at: <https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/>.

## [Handcalcs](https://github.com/connorferster/handcalcs)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/192/calculations-by-hand-but-in-the-compter-with-handcalcs>*

handcalcs is a library to render Python calculation code automatically in Latex, but in a manner that mimics how one might format their calculation if it were written with a pencil: write the symbolic formula, followed by numeric substitutions, and then the result.

## [LittleTable](https://github.com/ptmcg/littletable)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/194/events-and-callbacks-in-the-python-language>*

The littletable module provides a low-overhead, schema-less, in-memory database access to a collection of user objects. littletable provides a DataObject class for ad hoc creation of semi-immutable objects that can be stored in a littletable Table. Tables can also contain user-defined objects, using those objects' `__dict__`, `__slots__`, or `_fields` mappings to access object attributes.

## [Events](https://pypi.org/project/Events/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/194/events-and-callbacks-in-the-python-language>*

The C# language provides a handy way to declare, subscribe to and fire events. Technically, an event is a ‚Äúslot‚Äù where callback functions (event handlers) can be attached to - a process referred to as subscribing to an event. Here is a handy package that encapsulates the core to event subscription and event firing and feels like a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù part of the language.

``` python
>>> def something_changed(reason):
...     print "something changed because %s" % reason
...

>>> from events import Events
>>> events = Events()
>>> events.on_change += something_changed
```

## [filprofiler](https://pythonspeed.com/products/filmemoryprofiler/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/185/this-code-is-snooping-on-you-a-good-thing>*

Fil is a new open source Python memory profiler ([currently hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/pythonspeed/filprofiler)), designed for code that processes large amounts of data: the kind of code written by data scientists, data engineers, and scientists.

Some features highlighted in episode 185:

- If your Python data pipeline is using too much memory, it can be very difficult to figure where exactly all that memory is going.
- What you need is some way to know exactly where peak memory usage is, and what code was responsible for memory at that point. And that‚Äôs exactly what the [Fil memory profiler](https://pythonspeed.com/products/filmemoryprofiler/) does.
- Many tools track just Python memory. *Fil captures*all allocations going to the standard C memory allocation APIs.
