üòé üêç Awesome lists about Python Bytes https://pythonbytes.fm/

[Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a weekly, short & sweet podcast by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) & [Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken). After having the podcast recommended numerous times by friends & colleagues, I decided to download every episode thus far on the 14th of September 2019. Over the next 174 days, whenever I was commuting, I'd listen to 171 episodes of Python bytes, learnt a stack of new things and found new amazing python packages.

![Python Bytes Image](https://pythonbytes.fm/static/img/banner_750.png)

This post is intended to list out the packages I'd noted down & their application. Total disclaimer, I haven't tried out all of these packages personally and I'm certain there is a plethora of other packages mentioned that I have not captured here, please reach out if theres anything to add!

I've attempted to sort these into a directory of sorts pending on what you're interested in looking at, and whether I found out about them through [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) or elsewhere (they will have a link to the episode if directly from [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/)).

Instead, CARTOframes give the ability to communicate reproducible analysis while providing the ability to gain from CARTO's services like hosted, dynamic or static maps and Data Observatory augmentation.
