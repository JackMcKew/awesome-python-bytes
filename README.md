*[https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/165/ranges-as-dictionary-keys-oh-my](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/165/ranges-as-dictionary-keys-oh-my)*

A light weight, zero dependency (only standard libs used), to the point (no bells and whistles) Microsoft Excel reader/writer python 2.7-3+ library.

[![Example Code](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl/blob/master/doc/source/_static/readme_demo.gif)](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl)

Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl

- (compatibility +1, small lib +1) pylightxl has no external dependencies (only uses python built-in standard libs).
(compatibility +1) pylightxl was written to be compatible for python 2.7-3+ under one single pylightxl version. It does not impose rules on users to switch versions.
- (small lib +1) pylightxl was written to simply read/write, thereby making the library small without any bells or whistles which makes it easy to compile with PyInstaller and other packagers
- (user friendly +1) pylightxl was written to be as pythonic and easy to use as possible. Core developers actively survey Stack Overflow questions on working with excel files to tailor the API for most common problems.
- (see xlrd before pylightxl) Note that the xlrd library is very similar in values to pylightxl, but with much more functionality! Please take a look at xlrd to see if it is a good fit for your project. So why pick pylightxl over xlrd that has much more to offer? Currently, xlrd does not have any active developers. Pylightxl is a new library aimed to help solve current excel data issues (as surveyed by Stack Overflow), please submit your suggestions to help improve this library together.

*[https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/90/a-django-async-roadmap](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/90/a-django-async-roadmap)*

*[https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/104/api-evolution-the-right-way](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/104/api-evolution-the-right-way)*

PySimpleGUI enables anyone with a week of PySimpleGUI education or more to develop an entirely custom desktop GUI application.  The underlying GUI frameworks supported include tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi.  PySimpleGUI code can be run on any of these underlying frameworks with little or often no modification to the source code.

Unlike other simplified GUI packages, PySimpleGUI has a rich palette of widgets that are not dumbed down and can be assembled into any configuration desired, resulting in applications that look and operate as if written directly in tkinter, Qt, etc.  Simple defines the ease of writing the programs, not the class of problems that are capable of being solved. 100's of demo programs are provided to give programmers a jump start on integrating with other packages such as OpenCV, Matplotlib.  There are over 500 GitHub projects currently using PySimpleGUI.

A couple recent projects include:

A series of Rainmeter-style "Desktop Widgets": <https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI-Widgets>

## [NBDev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/178/build-a-pypi-package-from-a-jupyter-notebook>*

`nbdev` is a library that allows you to fully develop a library in Jupyter Notebooks, putting all your code, tests and documentation in one place. That is: you now have a true literate programming environment, as envisioned by Donald Knuth back in 1983!

Using the interactive environment, you can easily debug and refactor your code. Add #export flags to the cells that define the functions you want to include in your python modules. Here, for instance, is how combined_cos is defined and documented in the `fastai` library:

[![NBDev Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev/master/nbs/images/export_example.png)](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

- Creates Python packages out of a notebook
- Creates documentation from the notebook
- Solves the git perma-conflict issues with git pre-commit hooks
- Use #export to declare a cell should become a function in the package
- Manages the boilerplate issues for creating Python packages (setup.py, etc)
- Makes testing possible inside notebooks
- Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and sync any changes automatically back into your notebooks (reverse basically)

## [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/30/you-are-not-google-and-other-ruminations>*

Hypothesis is a Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldn‚Äôt have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy to add to any existing test suite.

It works by letting you write tests that assert that something should be true for every case, not just the ones you happen to think of.

## [Safer](https://github.com/rec/safer)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/180/transactional-file-io-with-python-and-safer>*

safer: a safer file opener

No more partial writes or corruption! For file streams, sockets or any callable.

``` python
# dangerous
with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
    json.dump(data, fp)
    # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

# safer
with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
    json.dump(data, fp)
    # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.
```

## [Codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/180/transactional-file-io-with-python-and-safer>*

Fix common misspellings in text files. It's designed primarily for checking misspelled words in source code, but it can be used with other files as well.

## [Interrogate](https://pypi.org/project/interrogate/)

*<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/181/it-s-time-to-interrogate-your-python-code>*

`interrogate` checks your code base for missing docstrings.

Documentation should be as important as code itself. And it should live within code. Python standardized docstrings, allowing for developers to navigate libraries as simply as calling `help()` on objects, and with powerful tools like Sphinx, pydoc, and Docutils to automatically generate HTML, LaTeX, PDFs, etc.

Enter: `interrogate`.

`interrogate` will tell you which methods, functions, classes, and modules have docstrings, and which do not. Use interrogate to:

- Get an understanding of how well your code is documented;
- Add it to CI/CD checks to enforce documentation on newly-added code;
- Assess a new code base for (one aspect of) code quality and maintainability.

A new kind of Progress Bar, with real-time throughput, eta and very cool animations!

``` python
from alive_progress import alive_bar
items = range(1000)                  # retrieve your set of items
with alive_bar(len(items)) as bar:   # declare your expected total
    for item in items:               # iterate as usual
        # process each item
        bar()                        # call after consuming one item
```
